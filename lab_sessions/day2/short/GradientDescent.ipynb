    "# Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization algorithms are the cornerstone of machine learning, because many learning tasks can be recast as an optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most widely spread optimization routines is gradient descent (also known as steepest descent), which is an iterative optimization method. Gradient descent seeks to *find a local minimum of a function* using only the information from the gradient (i.e., it performs first-order optimization). If we are *maximizing* a function instead of minimizing, we use gradient ascent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behing gradient descent is simple. It relies on the fact that *the gradient of a function points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of that function*. Thus, if we follow the negative gradient, we will walk towards the direction of the greatest rate of decrease. By following the negative gradient, we will end up converging to a (local) minimum of the function. In contrast, by following the gradient, we will converge to a (local) maximum of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider that we want to minimize a function $f(x)$ with respect to the variable $x$. The variable $x$ can be a vector. The gradient of the function, $\\nabla_x f(x)$, is a vector of the same length of $x$ that points to the direction of steepest ascent. Assume that we have an initial guess $x_0$ of where the minimum might be (in practice, the initial guess $x_0$ can be chosen depending on the available information, or even randomly). We can refine $x_0$ by following the negative gradient at that point, $\\nabla_x f(x_0)$:\n",
    "$$ x_1 = x_0-\\rho_0 \\nabla_x f(x_0) $$\n",
    "Here, $\\rho_0$ is a scalar that denotes the stepsize. For now, let us simply consider that $\\rho_0$ is \"small enough.\" Then, $x_1$ can be closer to the actual local minimum than the initial guess. We can apply this process iteratively to further refine the solution as\n",
    "$$ x_{t+1} = x_t-\\rho_t \\nabla_x f(x_t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "As a simple initial example, consider that $x=[x_0, x_1]^\\top$ is a 2-dimensional vector, and the function $f(x)$ is given by\n",
    "$$ f(x) = \\left(x_1-\\frac{5.1}{4\\pi^2}x_0^2+\\frac{5}{\\pi}x_0-6\\right)^2+10\\left(1-\\frac{1}{8\\pi}\\right)\\cos(x_0)+10.$$\n",
    "This complicated function is called \"Branin function.\"\n",

    "**Visualize how this function looks like.** The code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluates $f(x)$.\n",
