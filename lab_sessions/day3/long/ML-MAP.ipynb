    "In this lab session, we will use the classic breast cancer data from Wisconsin. It contains 569 observations of dimensionality 30 each. Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The goal is to detect whether the image corresponds to a malignant or benign tumor. This dataset is available in [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html). For more details, see the [UCI repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets).\n",
