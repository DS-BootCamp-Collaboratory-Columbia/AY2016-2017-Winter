    "The two most commonly used measures of effectiveness in information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML) are precision and recall. They were originally introduced to summarize and compare search results. They are often reffered to as relevance measures. The difference between the two is in finding how well does the model perform in terms of having returned results being relevant (precision) versus returning all relevant results (recall). In IR they are defined in the following way:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a search query and its set of relevant documents (known a priori) the retrieval model returns a ranked list of documents, i.e. the **retrieved** documents. **Precision** is defined as the ratio between the number of retrieved and relevant documents and the total number of **retrieved** documents. It gives us the proportion of retrieved documents that are relevant. **Recall** is defined as ratio between the number of retrieved and relevant documents and the total number of **relevant** documents for that query. Recall gives us the proportion of relevant documents that are retrieved:\n",
    "$$\\Large Precision= \\frac{|Relevant\\ \\&\\ Retrieved|}{|Retrieved|}$$  \n",
    "$$\\Large Recall = \\frac{|Relevant\\ \\&\\ Retrieved|}{|Relevant|}$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "In IR precision and recall are often computed for a given ranked position. It is often the case that systems are evaluated in terms of precision or recall at a certain rank (e.g. P@10/P10, R@10/R10). Sometimes systemâ€™s performance is reported in terms of an average of the precisions (AP) at the ranks where relevant documents occur. When AP is computed across multiple test queries a mean of the AP values is reported. This measure is called mean average precision (MAP).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In ML for tasks such as classification, where the model output is not a ranked list, precision and recall are defined in terms of the true positives (tp), false positives (fp), and false negatives (fn):  \n",

    "$$\\Large Precision= \\frac{|tp|}{|tp+fp|}$$  \n",
    "$$\\Large Recall = \\frac{|tp|}{|tp+fn|}$$  \n",

    "One way to categorize evaluation measures is based on whether they evaluate the model on a particular task (i.e. extrinsically), which requires ground truth information of the model performance as we noticed in the previous example when computing precision and recall. Another way to evaluate the performance of the model is based on how well the model represents the collection (i.e. intrinsically). In many instances due to the nature of the model and/or due to lack of well defined extrinsic task, models are evaluated based on how well they could predict a held-out set. One commonly used intrinsic evaluation approach is to measure the log-likelihood of the held out set (i.e. the test set).  \n",

The randomization test helps us determine whether the difference in the test statistic used to judge the two models/systems is statistically significant or not, i.e. whether the difference happened by chance (e.g. a noise introduced in the evaluation process). We have two evaluation results obtained from averaging a certain evaluation measure across the points in our test set using two models.

For example, these ranked lists could contain the performance of a particular model across different configurations of the same parameter. To give a concrete example, let's say we have 4 different types of topic models and each model is evaluated using 7 different topic configurations (T=20,30,40,50,60,70 and 80). Given two such ranked lists we need to come up with a decision whether model A ranks the performance of the different settings similarly to model B. In other words we need to quantify the correlation between the two ranked lists. We do that using correlation coefficients. In order to measure the strength of the linear relationship we use linear correlation coefficients such as Pearson coefficient (often referred to as Pearson's $R$). When the goal of our correlation analysis is the relationship between the rankings of different models we turn to rank correlation coefficients such as Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation coefficient ($\\rho$)."
