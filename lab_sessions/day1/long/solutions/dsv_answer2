**[Answer 2]** If we look at the x and y values we see that we've used absolute population numbers across all states. Therefore it is natural to see California, the state with the highest population having the highest number of food stamp participants and the highest number of votes. Using absolute population numbers is not helping us with analyzing the relationship between these two variables. In order for our analysis to be correct we would have to normalize these numbers with the total population living in the state. In other words rather than using absolute numbers we should be using percentages.
