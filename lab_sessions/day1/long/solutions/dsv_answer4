**[Answer 4]** If we compare the two plots we notice a trend where it is more likely for states that have high perecentage of participants in the food stamp program to vote for a Democratic candidate. This is in line with previous analysis also covered in Prof. Gelman's book. On the other hand states that voted for Donald Trump don't necessarly always have a small percentage of participants in the food stamp program. Another observation is that in states such as WV that have high food stamp program participation the wining candidate is Donald Trump. 
**[Note]** We could do another type of analysis which is a bar plot of the difference between the two votes.
