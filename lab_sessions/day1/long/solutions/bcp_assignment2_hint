**[Hint]**
We are tasked to compute the following conditional probabilities:  

$p(Borough\ |\ northern\ red\ oak)$,  

given that the person has visited all five boroughs within the past month with the following probability:  

$p(Borough=Brooklyn)=\frac{10}{31}$  

$p(Borough=Manhattan)=\frac{15}{31}$  

$p(Borough=Staten\ Island)=\frac{2}{31}$  

$p(Borough=Bronx)=\frac{2}{31}$  

$p(Borough=Queens)=\frac{2}{31}$
